r1.3 137

*Fixed the Red Stringed Spoofer not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer not actively restoring its damage like the manasteel tools do.

r1.3 136
*<b>Added Red String and Red Stringed Blocks</b>. These can interact with other blocks remotely.

*Changed the brewery texture to a more appropriate one. (Yulife)
*Combining a Floating (any color) Flower with any botania flower with an effect (manastar, pure daisy, any generating or functional...) will replace the flower there with the one you put. The flower will still act like normally, but has the visual and technical properties of a Floating Flower.
*Fixed mod slabs letting light pass through.
*Fixed some tpyos in the elven lore page. <i>I desperately need someone to proofread the nonsense I write.</i>
*Fixed the game crashing if one tries to look up uses for the Tainted Blood Pendant in NEI.
*Fixed the runic altar not saving the amount of mana it should get (and thus causing the amount of mana it has to reset to 0 when it loads back).
*Fixed there being a missing texture on the terra plate, resulting in some unneeded log errors.
*Having Night Vision on a Tainted Blood Pendant will no longer make the brightness blink obnoxiously.
*Hopefully fixed entry sharing being somewhat fiddly in SMP.
*Removed the text that says that Bursts would work in the Terrasteel crafting, because it seems everyone gets confused and decides not to use sparks even though it clearly says it's the best way >.<

*The Gaia Guardian now spawns a few less mobs and spawns them in a smaller radius. It won't spawn pig zombies or spiders any more, but you might get witches.

r1.3 134
*Fixed crash when looking at a mana pool if dark quartz is disabled in the config.

*Added a Brew of Restoration, it's like the brew of Revitalization but it's Regeneration I for 2 minutes and uses redstone in the crafting.
*Added new lore/backstory pages for the events that separated the elves' world from the overworld. It's worth a read, but not required. Some text in the original entries was also changed to reflect.
*Added the Tainted Blood Pendant, it can store potions and give the player their effects while it's worn, for the cost of mana.
*Added the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate, which serves as the new method to create Terrasteel. You'd be wise to look at the Terrasteel page to check out how it works. It's pretty similar to the old method but allows for more control and can be done earlier in the game.
*Changed the Gaia Guardian fight a whole bunch, it's harder now to compensate for the new items and the fact that it can take damage from the Terra Blade now. Brews and a Terra Blade are a must now. The entry in the lexicon now describes the recommended gear. You can see what it does for yourself ;)

r1.2 120

*Added the Crimson Pendant, a "tier 2" Pyroclast Pendant that does what the old one used to pre-nerf.
*Added the Hand of Ender, an item that allows not only for access of one's ender chest, but of others' via right clicking on them. (the last feature can be toggled in the config).
*Added The Spectator, a new bauble that lets you search for items in inventories, dropped around, in players/horses' inventories, equipped by mobs and that villagers trade.
*Changed the recipe for the Pyroclast Pendant to make more sense with the recent nerf.
*The Pixies the Gaia Guardian spawns no longer take non-player damage, so you can't cheese the battle with Tiny Planet + Terra Blade. <i>Sorry Lewis :3</i>
r1.1 94
*Added Mob Spawners to the Botania creative tab. Using a spawn egg on them changes the mob it's spawning, similar to MC:PE.
*Added the Ender Overseer, a new block that detects when players are looking at it and gives out a redstone signal.
*Nerfed the Pyroclast Pendant, now it only protects the wearer from fire damage if they are not standing on fire or lava.
r1.1 93
*Actually fix the skull renderer because I'm an undereducated idiot who has no clue what they're doing or how the java compiler works :V
r1.1 92
*Doubled the range in which the Mana Enchanter can pull from Mana Pools. The range it was before was stupidly low anyway.
*Fixed Azulejo blocks pointing to the wrong lexicon entry.
*The new skull renderer only registers on 1.7.10 since they changed the skin system and I can't compile for both functions.
*[API] Added oreZinc to the list of ores the Orechid can spawn.
*[API] Increased version number to 6.
r1.1 91
*Added new building blocks: Reed Block, Thatch, Netherrack Bricks, Soul Bricks, Snow Bricks, <a href="http://www.madeireirafalsarella.com.br/arquivos/produtos/telhas/portuguesa/01-g.jpg">Roof Tiles</a> (all with stair and slab variants) and 12 types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo">Azulejos</a> for use with white Quartz.
*Hopperhocks will no longer pick items up right after a mana pool crafts them.
*I was playing with TC and realized I wanted Botania armor mixed in with the Goggles of Revealing, so you can do that now.
*Lowered the chance for the Lexica Botania to spawn in the Bonus Chest, according to almighty reddit it was too high.
*Player heads now render with the hat/hair layer as they do in the normal model, so your crafted heads won't look weird now. Thanks to Kihira for this!
*Removed the Baubles Button from the inventory as that feature is provided by Baubles itself now.
r1.1 90
*Added a new generating flower, the Gourmaryllis, it eats food to make mana, but there's a catch...
*Added a new recipe for Mana Alchemy, Coarse Dirt (just vanilla dirt with metadata value 1, grass can't spread to it, the stuff that spawns in the Mega Taiga).
*Added Rainbows for Nemsun.
*Added the Crafty Crate (and a Placeholder item for use with it), a counterpart to the Open Crate that can autocraft items.
*Fixed a crash when binding the Wand of the Forest to a spreader and right clicking on something with no collision box (tall grass, flowers, etc).
*Fixed chat spam when using a Wand of the Forest or spawning pixies.
*Fixed the Kindle Lens destroying blocks.
*Fixed the Wand of the Forest trying to interact with objects on the client when it's bound to a spreader. So when bound to a spreader, mana pools will no longer change their mode in the client but update when clicked normally.
*Lowered default flower quantity and density to 2 and 16 respectively (was 3 and 32).
*Lowered default villager shed avg interval from 82000 to 226000 (this won't affect old configs).
*The Hopperhock is now more efficient at picking up items and picks up any it can find instead of just one at a time, this makes automating systems that require timing a lot easier.
*The Hopperhock now respects inventory max stack sizes.
*The Mana Enchanter is more expensive and puts less empahsis in the rarity of the enchantment.
*The Mana Pool no longer has a cooldown between being able to craft items but rather a timer on when it can "re-craft" an item after it crafted it (see wood log transmutation for example).
*The Mana Pool will no longer emit charging/discharging FX if no transfer happened (when either the pool or the item is full/empty).
*The Snowflake Pendant no longer creates ghost ice blocks in the client and is now properly centered on the player.
*Toned down the mana pool charging/discharging fx for sake of performance.
*[API] Added ILaputaImmobile for blocks that shouldn't be able to be moved by the Shard of Laputa. For Victorious3 for BetterStorage crates.
*[API] Incremented version to 5.
r1.1 89
*Added a means of creating players heads (elven knowledge).
*Added some Illustrations to the Daybloom and Hydroangeas entries to explain better how they work.
*Added the Life Imbuer, a means of allowing spawners to work without players nearby.
*If a Wand of the Forest is bound to a spreader, it'll always show that spreader's bounding box instead of any other, to make it more obvious.
*Spreaders now aim to the center of blocks taking their collision box in mind and not a 1x1x1 box.

r1.1 88
*Added a "If you have this, it means something went wrong, you should report it" message to the fallback flower (The Poppy textured "Botania Flower"), in case somebody gets it somehow.
*Added the Rod of the Highlands, an upgrade to the Rod of the Lands that lets you place blocks in midair.
*Changed some documentation.<ul><li>The Runic Altar's entry now has a small preface telling players they should look into Mana Manipulation first.</li><li>The Mana Spreader's entry now has clearer instructions for how the rotating is done and documentation for the fact that you can disable it with a redstone signal.</li><li>The disclaimer that lenses only function when there's a proper block to shoot at has been changed and moved to a single page rather than being on various lenses' pages.</li></ul>
*Fixed Mana Burst particles going above the spreader on the first few ticks.
*Fixed shaders not compiling sometimes and causing crashes/log spam. <i>I have no idea what I'm doing :V</i>
*Fixed the Gaia Guardian being able to freeze the game if it falls in a ravine or equivalent (found this while fighting it in an island made by the Shard of Laputa).
*Fixed the Hyacidus wasting mana by trying to poison undead.

r1.1 87
*Fixed Mana Spreaders freezing your game, woot!
*Removed the ability for the Rod of the Seas to place water in the nether, after some thought it wasn't that great of an idea after all.

r1.1 85
*<b>Botania should now work properly in a developer environment</b> and not complain about sand in it's eyes or something.

*Added the Infrangible Platform, a counterpart to the Abstruse and Spectral Platforms only available in creative, its' collision box is similar to a regular block and it's unbreakable, it's meant for mapmakers, see.
*Added the Ring of Far Reach (Elven Knowledge), it increases your reach by 3 blocks.
*Changed the Terra Shatterer texture to Futureazoo's. See previous link.
*Fixed the Drum of the Gathering dropping the Drum of the Wild instead.
*Fixed the Mana Lens crafting recipe only allowing you to use invalid combinations instead of valid ones.
*Fixed the Shard of Laputa...<ul><li>Being allowed to go above world height.</li><li>Sometimes having an offset of 1 block.</li><li>Being able to be used in the nether</li><li>Being able to mobilize Bedrock and other unbreakable blocks.<li>Overriding any blocks already in the area.</li><li>Stopping if the player relogs.</li><li>Creating bursts that can be pulled by the Tiny Planet <i>(lol)</i>.</li></ul>
*Fixed the Tiny Planet creating way too many particles when used with the Terra Blade.

*Removed the <i>feature</i> where the Tiny Potato would take over other mods' item renders.

*[API] Added getTicksExisted() to IManaBurst.
*[API] Added ITinyPlanetExempt.
*[API] Incremented Version number to 4.
r1.1 84

*Added the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bNEIOkUuH0">Shard of Laputa</a>, endgame item, generates a floating island.
*Added the Drum of the Gathering. Kinda like the Drum of the Wild, but for animals.

*Fixed Elementium Armor having a 100% chance to spawn pixies.
*Items that come out of the Elven Portal get asigned an NBT tag to prevent them from going back in, in case some other mod adds recipes (like Modtweaker).
*Lowered the amount of Gaia Spirits the Gaia Guardian drops (from 12 to 8).
*Renamed "Mystical Instruments" to "Mystical Items", because it makes more sense and is less confusing.
*The Petal Apothecary now has a smarter checking for what it considers seeds. Read: Natura Hop<i>seed</i> wood won't work now :p
*Tweaked the Mana Burst particles, now they never leave any empty space between them, so you get a proper straight burst when you fire it with a mana blaster instead of a bunch of loose particles. The color and size also randomizes a bit to make each burst distint, even if just by a bit.
r1.1 83
*Changed the Lexicon HUD icon to be a lot less intrusive.
*Fixed Gaia Pylons' in-world lexicon click going to the wrong entry.
*Shaders now use GLSL version 120 instead of whatever they feel like. Should fix issues with some GPUs having lag with them enabled. If your GPU doesn't support GLSL version 120 you should consider upgrading (or turning shaders off in the config I guess).
*The Charm of the Diva is now a lot more reliable.
r1.1 82
*Added a config option to disable the animation when an item is charging on a mana pool.
*Added some Botania loot to the Bonus Chest, Stronghold and Dungeon chests.

*Fixed the daffomill (sometimes?) creating a rubberbanding effect on the client. (I couldn't reproduce this issue so I can only assume that fix did it)
*The Gaia Guardian now blocks flight.
r1.1 81
*Fixed a crash when breaking a mana pool, since the fix for the crash when placing a mana spreader broke that. >_>

*[API] Increased apiVersion to 3.
r1.1 76

*Fixed Bifrost blocks being pickupable in creative.
*Fixed some seeds not getting picked up by the petal apothecary (any registered with "Seed" in the name rather than "seed" because the check was case sensitive). (ganymedes01)
*The burst from a Damaging Lens or Terra Blade now has a larger collision box and hits mobs in a small radius around it.
*The Flugel Tiara is now made with Elementium.
*The Mana Usage display for Mana Infusion and Runic Crafting recipes in the Lexica Botania now shows that it's on a 10:1 ratio. Hovering over the bar changes it to 1:1 ratio.

r1.1 75

*Increased the range in which the terrasteel crafting process can pull mana from.

*Fixed the block breaking particles of the creative mana pool being of the Livingrock Bricks.
*Having a Mana Void or any Catalyst below the Mana Pool changes it's texture.

*The Mana Blaster now has a subtle flicker effect on it's texture.
*The Mana Detector now emits some red particles while it's emiting a redstone signal.

r1.1 70
*<b>Massively optimized the particle render code.</b> Botania particles will no longer kill your fps. In doing this they also render properly over water now, so that's neat. <i>Yo Azanor, you should do this too for nitor.</i>
*Added <a href="https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/484136285251309568">Matrix Mode</a> as a config option. This was a visual glitch I got while changing the particle code that I decided to leave in because it was funny.
r1.1 69
*Added a new lens (that requires elven knowledge), the Paintslinger Lens.
*Changed the Pixie Dust texture to be pink to match the other elven resources and the pixie mob texture. <i>You were waiting for it, confess.</i>

r1.1 63
*Fixed generating flowers in the corners of chunks (and in general) causing lots of unnecessary chunk updates.
*Fixed lack of canUpdate() override on TileManaVoid, in theory this shouldn't impact performance unless you somehow had hundreds of them, but it fixes MCPC+ complaining. <i>/shrug.</i>

r1.1 62

r1.1 61

*Fixed Mana Spreaders not showing the prediction beam, another thing broken by 54...
r1.0 55
*Added some sanity checking to the flowers' connection code to reflect the changes in 54, be it for Spreaders or Pools. In theory, this ought to fix the bug where flowers lose their binding upon relog. I can't exactly tell you if that is the case though, because this issue is completely sporadic and nigh-on impossible to reproduce with consistency. <i><b>Warning</b>: This change modifies API files SubTileGenerating.java and SubTileFunctional.java. Third time's the charm, right? Please be so.</i>
*Mana Mirrors no longer show their binding in the tooltip, but rather in world.
*[API] Added ICoordBoundItem.
r1.0 54
*Added some checks to the adding of mana spreaders and mana pools to the world. In theory, this ought to fix the bug where flowers lose their binding upon relog.

*Added some new items that don't do anything yet, don't mind them, I just happened to have them done before I pushed this update.
r1.0 53
*Fixed compatibility with the latest forge versions with ore dictionary changes. <b>The mod now requires forge 1117 at minimum</b>.
r1.0 52
*Added sound effects to the Petal Apothecary.

r1.0 51

*Added fancy versioning to the Lexica Botania.
*Added some sanity checking to the flowers' connection code, be it for Spreaders or Pools. In theory, this ought to fix the bug where flowers lose their binding upon relog.

*Fixed the Soulscribe being able to be blocked with. <i>How does that even work anyway?</i>
*Fixed the config file re-saving if nothing changed.
*Renaming the Lexica Botania changes it's cover and title.
r1.0 50

r1.0 48
*Fixed Generating Flowers never outputting any mana whatsoever to spreaders.
*<i>*sigh*</i>
r1.0 47
*Added a config option to disable the references in the flowers' tooltips. <i>Though, be warned, I hate you if you do <3</i>

*Fixed Composite lenses not being localized.
*Fixed a crash with right clicking the Abtruse Platform with an empty hand.
*Fixed generating flowers outputting ALL their power to spreaders even if they can't take all of it. <i><b>Warning</b>: This change modifies API files SubTileGenerating.java and IManaCollector.java.</i>
*[API] Added IAddonEntry for subtitle support on entries, mostly to prevent the whole [TT] or the like thing in Thaumcraft addons.
r1.0 46
*Added the Abtruse Platform, a block to help you get around. <i>Totally not a copy paste from Thaumic Tinkerer, nope.</i>
*Added the Manastar flower (under the Mana Manipulation section), which lets you measure if you're getting a profit or loss of mana.
*Droped the nerfhammer on Dayblooms and Nightshades. To start off, they're a bit slower by default now. They also suffer diminshing returns from having any flowers of the same type adjacent. Go get creative with better mana generation methods now.
